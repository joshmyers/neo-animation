# What is this?

Some scripts for running animations on a neopixel ring attached to a Raspberry Pi. And the console, too.

# Is it any good?

Yes.

# How do I run it?

Edit the scripts. Run them with ruby.

# It won't run!

Yes it will.

On your mac, for console rendering: `gem install paint`

On your raspberry pi, install the `pixel_pi` and `paint` ruby gems:

```sh
gem install pixel_pi
gem install paint
```
